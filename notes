Problems with manual testing

- Too repetitive (not following DRY principle).
- Can forget and leave behind unused code that you only used for testing.
- Too many console.logs.

Benefits of automated testing

- Follows DRY principle (don't repeat yourself).
- Ensures code work as expected.
- Easier to refactor code later on.
- Offers faster feedback in a descriptive and readable way.
- Test files seperate from real code.

Test Suite

- A container for multiple tests related to that specific container context.

Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for code that has a specific purpose.

Test-Driven Development

- write failing test cases first (red), make test pass (green), refactor code (refactor), repeat.

Best Practices

- describe unit to be tested, describe various conditions and how code is expected to work under each condition.
- scale test conditions gradually from simple to complex.

beforeEach

- follows DRY principle (don't repeat setting a variable multiple times)
- decare variable at top of test suite then assign it in beforeEach function so each test has access to the variable (non-mutative)
